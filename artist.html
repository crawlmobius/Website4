<h2>John MacCormick</h2>
<p>NZ Painting stocks several paintings of John MacCormick. John (1945- ) studied art at the Elam School of Fine Art in Auckland, New Zealand. At 1950s the emphasis was mainly on drawing. Later on he worked as a graphic designer. </p>
<p>MacCormick's early creations included many watercolours painted in the Tongariro National Park. Later paintings include a wide range of subjects from landscapes, interiors, portraits, still life, to the surreal. Of special interest to him is the emotional power of buildings in the New Zealand landscape that tell of those who have gone before us. </p>
<p>Although the motifs are from contemporary New Zealand-people, the buildings around them and the landscape-stylistically there are influences from his exposure to French impressionist works and early watercolours: Degas, other French impressionists, Matisse, and the history of painting.</p>
<p> The watercolours of the nineteenth century explorer artists were an early influence, as were the impressionist painters, Renoir and Degas. Bill's prints are enormously popular - we have have noticed during TV interviews that one of his prints even decorates the living room of (now ex Prime Minister) Helen Clark's Auckland residence!</p>
<p> Awards: 
Several National Bank watercolour awards during the 1970's. </p>
